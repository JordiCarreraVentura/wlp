    "As you can see, we can easily use NLTK's methods to get the sentences in a text, or the words in that text. Some systems do not need sentences as input and are designed to work with the individual words in each document (text classification, sentiment analysis, or term extraction can all work either at the sentence or the document level with little difference overall). However, sentences will be useful when building statistical models like n-gram models (we will see that in more detail in a bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokens\n",
    "The term _words_ we used in the previous paragraph is technically incorrect. At this level, we are still working with __tokens__, which include all words in a text plus any punctuation signs, plus any numerical expressions, plus virtually anything else. Strictly speaking, the number \"103\" is not a word but it can appear in a text. Therefore, it is a __token__. A __token__ refers to anything that appears within __word boundaries__. Word boundaries are not always well-defined and even today there are inconsistencies in the way some tokens are handled by different systems: some consider _didn't_ two separate words, and tokenize it as _did not_, whereas others take it as a single word. For our purposes, _did not_ is preferable to _didn't_ but, generally speaking, we would like our system to be robust to this type of thing. That is, we don't want to have to teach it explicitly that _did not_ and _didn't_ are two variants of the same linguistic unit. We want the system to infer that from their behavior as observed in the data. That will be when we will be able to claim we are doing something close to machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Punctuation\n",
    "Although some advanced applications can handle non-word tokens such as punctuation (for instance, to skip parenthetical elements inside a sentence, or appositions), most applications do not do much with it once the sentences have been split. Generally speaking, we can ignore punctuation in most tasks and we will still get the desired results, assuming we can train a good sequence model (we will see what this means later).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical expressions\n",
    "The case of numerical expressions is more complicated because most systems tend to remove any patterns involving digits, which is fine in many cases. Sometimes, however, and depending on the task you are working on, numerical information will be crucial for the system: in many applications in which time information is important (for example, a website for booking flights needs to detect and process the dates of a trip), numerical information cannot be removed. Instead, a specific parser is usually required to handle each particular type of information: temporal expressions, clothing sizes for eBay product match, serial number recognition, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A quick note on feature engineering\n",
    "_These are all important points regarding __feature engineering__, and the main reason why we said earlier that developing a good understanding of the data is so important in NLP: unless you are certain that your data contains enough examples to account for the phenomena you want to model (so that enough features can be derived from it and the system can learn the appropriate behavior), the algorithm will not be able to make sense of the data. You cannot train a system for detecting flight information without information about flights. NLP often has the responsibility of keeping things real in machine learning and asking questions like **\"So you want your system to detect funny content... Are you detecting any jokes right now?\"**_ :)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Letter case\n",
    "The previous examples also contain a particular type of word variant, __letter case__. Case refers to whether a word is __UPPERCASE__, __lowercase__, __Titlecase__, or some __CoMbInAtIoN__ of both (the last one is often called __camel case__).\n",
    "\n",
    "A common type of preprocessing step consists in lowercasing all words, collapsing or case variants into their lowercase form. This will normally preserve most of the original information (the meaning of _combination_ does not usually change based on its case), although there are obviously exceptions (a _bond_ refers to a type of agreement or to a strong link, whereas _Bond_ is a secret agent. In most corpora there will be no confusion, but that might not be the case in a dataset about movie reviews. Again, knowing your data is important to make this kind of decisions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of collapsing all these variants into a single one is to prevent the system from considering _the, The_ and _THE_ three different words, which would result in incorrectly dividing their frequency counts three-fold when calculating their probabilities, for instance. This type of normalization can easily boost the frequency of some terms several times, which results in a statistical model much closer to the actual truth of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## On the topic of variants\n",
    "Letter case is just a subtype of the more general fact that words have variants, and there are other types of variation that will make your NLP lives miserable. The two main types are __inflectional variation__ and __misspellings__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflectional variation is what the type of variation whereby we recognize the words _child_ and _children_ to be two __forms__ of the same __lemma__. The lemma is usually seen as referring to the actual concept, whereas the forms account for morphological variation, alternative shapes that the lemma takes to fit in particular linguistic contexts such as the plural number, or verb tenses. In languages like Spanish or Ukrainian, inflections are much richer than in English, and the amount of variation is also much higher, which usually requires some additional processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, the two main ways of dealing with __forms__ is to either __stem__ them or __lemmatize__ them. Stemming is usually faster, easier, and error-prone. The main problem is that there is no guarantee that you end up with actual lemma. Lemmatization, on the other hand, tries to fulfill that requirement, but it has a number of relatively strong pressupositions: 1) part-of-speech tagging, which is not always trivial and that we will introduce later on, and 2) most often, a language-specific dictionary with mappings between forms and their lemmas. For now, let's take a look at the differences with a simple example. As always, NLTK can help us, although there are now other libraries we can use for this: __pattern__ and __spacy__, which offer better performance than NLTK for some tasks."

    "Now is probably a good time to introduce [parts of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech) (PoS for short).

Latin grammarians (!!) already described word behavior based on parts of speech, which simply means how a word (form) behaves within a sequence of words.\n",

Nouns are a prerequisite for linguistic behavior, but not really its end goal. Language starts to be really useful when it __adds knowledge__, when new information is added through combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with two ideas, _person_ and _height_ -what if there is a connection between the two? What if that person is tall? _Height_ now becomes an attribute of _person_ (both ideas go together), and language will now use an __adjective__ to express that the two ideas in the sequence are not independent but are actually connected. That is, when an idea specifies another idea, it becomes an adjective (or behaves like one, such as the genitive case in Ukrainian or _de_-preposition phrases in Spanish):\n",
    "\n",
    "> _tall person_\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have seen words or combinations of words, but we are still not conveying thoughts. That is, we can build any sequence of nouns and adjectives, as long as we want. The question is, what for? Or rather, where do we stop? The standard way to mark that a sequence of ideas is a closed, complete unit that we can then transmit, is through a __verb__:\n",

    "\n",
    "> Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples above still involve the same concepts as before, yet only these last examples are valid sentences that we can find in a corpus, something with a truth value that can be regarded as an assertion about the world. Verbs turn potentially endless sequences of noun combinations into a bounded thought we can express.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the main parts of speech, although there are a few others:\n",
    "* pronouns (placeholders for nouns),\n",
    "* adverbs (adjectives for verbs or for other adjectives),\n",
    "* prepositions (they create adverbs from nouns or noun phrases, including pronouns),\n",
    "* conjunctions (they create nouns, adjectives or adverbs from verbs and their nouns),\n",
    "* determiners and quantifiers (usually adjectives in origin, but they end up as an indispensable part of nouns, to the point that nouns cannot be used without some determiner. For example, countable nouns in the singular can almost never be used without a determiner: _The dog barked_ versus _*Dog barked_).\n",
    "\n",
    "The three first categories (noun, adjectives and verbs) are open classes: new words are being added every day (especially true for nouns, just think of all new movie and song titles, people names, software version names, etc.) The last four are usually closed classes and their elements tend to remain constant over very large time spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very broad and overly simplified overview of parts of speech. Since language is messy, there are often cases of unclear boundaries across categories, as well as many cases of ambiguous words intersecting several categories. We will go back to this later."

    "#### TFIDF (mutual information) and conditional probability\n",
    "TFIDF stands for __term frequency * inverse document frequency__. The intuition behind it is that the most relevant words in any document will be the most frequent words in that document (because they appear all over the place: \"work, work, work\") that are, at the same time, the least frequent on the overall dataset (in the sense that they will be unique to the current document: if no or very few other documents speak about the same topic, that topic can be assumed to be very characteristic of that particular document). So, it is a mathematical formula of what is both __important (frequent) and specific (inversely frequent over all documents)__ about a given document. This type of information is usually called the most __salient__ information.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFIDF often works at the document level within the same dataset, so here the system in fact needs the dataset to be divided into documents (that means that TFIDF cannot be directly calculated for short text inputs such as tweets, or at least that it will not yield any meaningful improvements over raw frequency counts unless some other segmentation of the data can be provided, at the topic level for instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the Reuters corpus is divided into documents so we can use it for our experiments. It is no coincidence ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "The TFIDF formula is quite popular in the field of Information Retrieval and it has been successfully applied in many NLP applications. It is often a standard measure of term relevance and you can hardly go wrong if you use it. Sometimes it seems that half of all NLP happens around the TFIDF formula :) (or some variation of it)."

When we take a look at the document, however, we can see it is in fact about **trade disputes in the _corn, gran_ industry**. The system has been able to make a correct inference and assign a new, correct category to the document, even when the human annotators did not do that themselves. This is a perfect example of bootstrapped/semi-supervised learning: we can first train an algorithm on some data annotated by people, and then use that system's decisions to easily add more data to our initial pool. Once a system gets to the point of being useful, it quickly becomes unstoppable :)\n",
    "5. And the cooler-yet result is hidden in the last group: at first, it seems a like a weird dump of different categories. All categories appear only once: the original document labeled as _earn_, the first suggestion as _iron-steel_, the others as _crude_ and _copper_. So, what happened here? Again, __machine learning happened__ :) If we pay attention to the documents' title, we can see that, in this group specifically, all dcuments start with the _TALKING POINT_ phrase. These documents are reports by analysts and feature prominently quotes of their statementsl. Although they have not been explicitly labeled as such in the Reuters corpus because in that corpus the tags are topic-based rather than genre-based, the algorithm does __sense__ something special and consistent about this group. If we look at the features triggering each match, it becomes evident that the pronoun _he_ is a constant, which makes sense because articles quoting analysts' opinions will tend to have a significant number of expressions like _he said, he claimed, he reported_. The system is able to pinpoint that on its own, and it is also interesting to think what would have happened if we had removed all stop words (_he_ is almost always considered one) -we would have lost one of the main predictors for the _talking point_ subset of our sample and would have probably never known it was there.

Apart from the cool factor of the name, it also happens to be technically correct :) (since we are building as our model a space containing some number of vectors, and the information in those vector faithfully represents semantic information -the relevance we saw in earlier sections-).\n",

    "That is why more efficient representations are commonly used. However, vectors are still at the core of any such representation, which simply use some trick or other to transform the vector into a more manageable object __without information loss__. Things can get very complicated in this area and there is an entire field of [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction) which is absolutely fascinating but totally beyond the scope of this course :D (For those who are really curious, you can check out (Random Forests/Ensemble Trees)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest] or (Principal Component Analysis)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis].\n",

    "A detailed technical explanation of intuitions behind the [__cosine similarity__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) would take some time :) so, to keep things simple, let's just say that it calculates the ratio between the sum of the weights of any non-zero-weight dimensions shared by two vectors, and the combined total weights for all dimensions of those two vectors. Because of operating in an Euclidean space, the final calculation also involves the __dot product__ and the __square root__ (see below for details :)"

    "Why is __Naïve Bayes__ called \"naïve\"? Because the model makes an assumption that is usually too well-intentioned :) Naïve Bayes models work on the feature __independence assumption__, which is, by the way, the mean reason why they are simple and fast, but also the main reason why so many people wonder how they can perform so well most of the time :)\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, the __independence assumption__ translates into the (very strong) assumption that the probabilities of each word in the document are independent from the presence of any other word in that document. That is, Naïve Bayes calculates the probability of words given the category of the documents they appear in (for instance, the fact that the word _politician_ appears more frequently in texts about politics), but it does not take into account the probability of a word given some other word (for instance, the fact that _politician_ and _ministry_ tend to appear together, or __co-ocurr__,  using the technical term, which stands for \"occurring/appearing together\").\n",
    "\n",
    "For Naïve Bayes, this means that two correlated words will each contribute to the overall score of the class. For the example above, _politician_ and _ministry_, that seems fine, though, since a text containing two words associated with the politics category should get some score from each separate word anyway. Independence seems fine in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "When is it not okay? In NLP, the __independence assumption__ can be particularly harmful with __collocations__ and __multiwords__. We will see these units in more detail in a bit, for now let's just say they are terms consisting of several tokens, such as _Barak H. Obama, president Barack Obama, cafe latte_ or _Lviv Computer Science Summer School_.\n",
    "\n",

To summarize, the __independence assumption__ may cause result in false positives due to awarding free (too generous) hits for tokens that are really parts of just one word. In NLP, this is a direct consequence of work-in-progress tokenization (now you see the importance of all that boring stuff about tokenization I told you about earlier ;) and how Computational Linguistics can make things easier for Machine Learning -__this__ is NLP). What this means is that not everything you can split on a whitespace is a word (and the fact that the opposite is also true is a *__well-known__ fact* ;), and sometimes the actual linguistic unit (the thing whose probability you should be calculating) will be something bigger, sometimes spanning a few words and sometimes even *discontinuous*, which makes it necessary to *__take__ these things __into account__*.\n",

Linear regression is the type of analysis that can tell you if people tend to have increasing amounts of ice-cream as temperatures rise towards the summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference of logistic regression with respect to standard linear regressions is that, whereas linear regression gives us a coefficient (how associated the independent and dependent variables are, with a value ranging from -1 to +1), logistic regression gives us a __probability-looking normalized score__ (a floating point number between 0. and 1.0) that we can use as an actual probability of the class (dependent variable) given the feature (independent variable). Zero means the feature does not predict the class, one means the feature predicts the class with absolute certainty. The normalization of this score is performed using the [__logistic function__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) (a type of [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function)) hence the technique's name.\n",

For convenience, below is some code ([via StackOverlow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7939259)) with a recap of linear regression.

That is, Logistic Regression __does not make the independence assumption__ and is able to deal feature correlations naturally by assigning them lower weights. In this way, a several-word-long linguistic unit no longer contributes to the final score for each of the tokens in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, Naïve Bayes calculates a probability for each word and finally multiplies the probabilities for all words, whereas Logistic Regression learns the weight for each word relative to the weights of rest of the words and, therefore, assigns to each its individual contribution over the maximum contribution that they all add up to.\n",

Essentially, they perform the same type of analysis as Logistic Regression classifiers (if we are talking about linear SVMs) with some differences in what is considered or high or low correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, Naïve Bayes often performs just as well as SVM classifiers (or better, despite their much higher simplicity) and Logistic Regression usually outperforms both. In my own experience, Maximum Entropy is usually the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main factor to look for when deciding when to use SVMs is the dimensionality of our space: SVMs can handle high numbers of dimensions but they usually cannot handle the multi-dimensionality of NLP data (at least, no without some serious normalization and dimensionality reduction, which are always possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the main reason why they will probably not be very useful unless you have some way to carry out a massive clean-up and normalization of the data."

Just to give you a frame of reference, below is a summary of some state-of-the-art results for classification on these corpora (some of these benchmarks are a bit old but I have not been able to find any more recents papers reporting better scores -which definitely does not mean they do not exist):\n",
    "\n",
    "* [This 2015 paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giacomo_Domeniconi/publication/281743455_A_Study_on_Term_Weighting_for_Text_Categorization_A_Novel_Supervised_Variant_of_tfidf/links/55f6ad7708aeafc8abf4f470.pdf) reports a maximum accuracy of nearly 94% and average accuracies of 92% on the Reuters corpus using __SVMs, and a number of variations of TFIDF as the feature weighting function, and feature selection__. The same configuration yielded scores in the mid-70% range on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. In our cases, __a barely normalized BoW-based vector space model combined with a Logistic Regression classifier__ allowed us to come very close of their top performance for Reuters (within 3-4%) and to outperform by ~10% their results on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. This is the kind of thing why we said earlier that Logistic Regression is usually the way to go ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the Brown corpus, one of the top accuracies reported is [a 2010 52%-result](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P10-1077) (over all categories, so quite low but definitely better than random -because you have many more categories than just two, which would amount to a 50% random baseline assuming a uniform distribution-). Our out-of-the box, nearly unmodified classifier matched that performance effortlessly, despite the fact that the authors of that paper were using more advanced features. Again, Logistic Regression can be seen to account for the difference (they used Linear Discriminant Analyis, a precursor to Logistic Regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Again on the 20 Newsgroups classifiers, the [Stanford team](http://nlp.stanford.edu) (in many ways, the founders of Natural Language Processing and modern Computational Linguistics) [report a nearly 82% accuracy](http://nlp.stanford.edu/wiki/Software/Classifier/20_Newsgroups) using their classifier. They report some previous results performing up to the ~82% mark, but they also report as \"suspect\" an earlier result achieving nearly 85% accuracy. Our own results suggest this last result actually seemed on the right track :) (for obvious reasons, Stanford people do not like other people getting better accuracies ;)\n",
