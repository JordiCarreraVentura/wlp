    "As you can see, we can easily use NLTK's methods to get the sentences in a text, or the words in that text. Some systems do not need sentences as input and are designed to work with the individual words in each document (text classification, sentiment analysis, or term extraction can all work either at the sentence or the document level with little difference overall). However, sentences will be useful when building statistical models like n-gram models (we will see that in more detail in a bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokens\n",
    "The term _words_ we used in the previous paragraph is technically incorrect. At this level, we are still working with __tokens__, which include all words in a text plus any punctuation signs, plus any numerical expressions, plus virtually anything else. Strictly speaking, the number \"103\" is not a word but it can appear in a text. Therefore, it is a __token__. A __token__ refers to anything that appears within __word boundaries__. Word boundaries are not always well-defined and even today there are inconsistencies in the way some tokens are handled by different systems: some consider _didn't_ two separate words, and tokenize it as _did not_, whereas others take it as a single word. For our purposes, _did not_ is preferable to _didn't_ but, generally speaking, we would like our system to be robust to this type of thing. That is, we don't want to have to teach it explicitly that _did not_ and _didn't_ are two variants of the same linguistic unit. We want the system to infer that from their behavior as observed in the data. That will be when we will be able to claim we are doing something close to machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Punctuation\n",
    "Although some advanced applications can handle non-word tokens such as punctuation (for instance, to skip parenthetical elements inside a sentence, or appositions), most applications do not do much with it once the sentences have been split. Generally speaking, we can ignore punctuation in most tasks and we will still get the desired results, assuming we can train a good sequence model (we will see what this means later).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical expressions\n",
    "The case of numerical expressions is more complicated because most systems tend to remove any patterns involving digits, which is fine in many cases. Sometimes, however, and depending on the task you are working on, numerical information will be crucial for the system: in many applications in which time information is important (for example, a website for booking flights needs to detect and process the dates of a trip), numerical information cannot be removed. Instead, a specific parser is usually required to handle each particular type of information: temporal expressions, clothing sizes for eBay product match, serial number recognition, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A quick note on feature engineering\n",
    "_These are all important points regarding __feature engineering__, and the main reason why we said earlier that developing a good understanding of the data is so important in NLP: unless you are certain that your data contains enough examples to account for the phenomena you want to model (so that enough features can be derived from it and the system can learn the appropriate behavior), the algorithm will not be able to make sense of the data. You cannot train a system for detecting flight information without information about flights. NLP often has the responsibility of keeping things real in machine learning and asking questions like **\"So you want your system to detect funny content... Are you detecting any jokes right now?\"**_ :)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Letter case\n",
    "The previous examples also contain a particular type of word variant, __letter case__. Case refers to whether a word is __UPPERCASE__, __lowercase__, __Titlecase__, or some __CoMbInAtIoN__ of both (the last one is often called __camel case__).\n",
    "\n",
    "A common type of preprocessing step consists in lowercasing all words, collapsing or case variants into their lowercase form. This will normally preserve most of the original information (the meaning of _combination_ does not usually change based on its case), although there are obviously exceptions (a _bond_ refers to a type of agreement or to a strong link, whereas _Bond_ is a secret agent. In most corpora there will be no confusion, but that might not be the case in a dataset about movie reviews. Again, knowing your data is important to make this kind of decisions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of collapsing all these variants into a single one is to prevent the system from considering _the, The_ and _THE_ three different words, which would result in incorrectly dividing their frequency counts three-fold when calculating their probabilities, for instance. This type of normalization can easily boost the frequency of some terms several times, which results in a statistical model much closer to the actual truth of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## On the topic of variants\n",
    "Letter case is just a subtype of the more general fact that words have variants, and there are other types of variation that will make your NLP lives miserable. The two main types are __inflectional variation__ and __misspellings__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflectional variation is what the type of variation whereby we recognize the words _child_ and _children_ to be two __forms__ of the same __lemma__. The lemma is usually seen as referring to the actual concept, whereas the forms account for morphological variation, alternative shapes that the lemma takes to fit in particular linguistic contexts such as the plural number, or verb tenses. In languages like Spanish or Ukrainian, inflections are much richer than in English, and the amount of variation is also much higher, which usually requires some additional processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, the two main ways of dealing with __forms__ is to either __stem__ them or __lemmatize__ them. Stemming is usually faster, easier, and error-prone. The main problem is that there is no guarantee that you end up with actual lemma. Lemmatization, on the other hand, tries to fulfill that requirement, but it has a number of relatively strong pressupositions: 1) part-of-speech tagging, which is not always trivial and that we will introduce later on, and 2) most often, a language-specific dictionary with mappings between forms and their lemmas. For now, let's take a look at the differences with a simple example. As always, NLTK can help us, although there are now other libraries we can use for this: __pattern__ and __spacy__, which offer better performance than NLTK for some tasks."

    "Now is probably a good time to introduce [parts of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech) (PoS for short).

Latin grammarians (!!) already described word behavior based on parts of speech, which simply means how a word (form) behaves within a sequence of words.\n",

Nouns are a prerequisite for linguistic behavior, but not really its end goal. Language starts to be really useful when it __adds knowledge__, when new information is added through combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with two ideas, _person_ and _height_ -what if there is a connection between the two? What if that person is tall? _Height_ now becomes an attribute of _person_ (both ideas go together), and language will now use an __adjective__ to express that the two ideas in the sequence are not independent but are actually connected. That is, when an idea specifies another idea, it becomes an adjective (or behaves like one, such as the genitive case in Ukrainian or _de_-preposition phrases in Spanish):\n",
    "\n",
    "> _tall person_\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have seen words or combinations of words, but we are still not conveying thoughts. That is, we can build any sequence of nouns and adjectives, as long as we want. The question is, what for? Or rather, where do we stop? The standard way to mark that a sequence of ideas is a closed, complete unit that we can then transmit, is through a __verb__:\n",

    "\n",
    "> Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples above still involve the same concepts as before, yet only these last examples are valid sentences that we can find in a corpus, something with a truth value that can be regarded as an assertion about the world. Verbs turn potentially endless sequences of noun combinations into a bounded thought we can express.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the main parts of speech, although there are a few others:\n",
    "* pronouns (placeholders for nouns),\n",
    "* adverbs (adjectives for verbs or for other adjectives),\n",
    "* prepositions (they create adverbs from nouns or noun phrases, including pronouns),\n",
    "* conjunctions (they create nouns, adjectives or adverbs from verbs and their nouns),\n",
    "* determiners and quantifiers (usually adjectives in origin, but they end up as an indispensable part of nouns, to the point that nouns cannot be used without some determiner. For example, countable nouns in the singular can almost never be used without a determiner: _The dog barked_ versus _*Dog barked_).\n",
    "\n",
    "The three first categories (noun, adjectives and verbs) are open classes: new words are being added every day (especially true for nouns, just think of all new movie and song titles, people names, software version names, etc.) The last four are usually closed classes and their elements tend to remain constant over very large time spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very broad and overly simplified overview of parts of speech. Since language is messy, there are often cases of unclear boundaries across categories, as well as many cases of ambiguous words intersecting several categories. We will go back to this later."

    "#### TFIDF (mutual information) and conditional probability\n",
    "TFIDF stands for __term frequency * inverse document frequency__. The intuition behind it is that the most relevant words in any document will be the most frequent words in that document (because they appear all over the place: \"work, work, work\") that are, at the same time, the least frequent on the overall dataset (in the sense that they will be unique to the current document: if no or very few other documents speak about the same topic, that topic can be assumed to be very characteristic of that particular document). So, it is a mathematical formula of what is both __important (frequent) and specific (inversely frequent over all documents)__ about a given document. This type of information is usually called the most __salient__ information.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFIDF often works at the document level within the same dataset, so here the system in fact needs the dataset to be divided into documents (that means that TFIDF cannot be directly calculated for short text inputs such as tweets, or at least that it will not yield any meaningful improvements over raw frequency counts unless some other segmentation of the data can be provided, at the topic level for instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the Reuters corpus is divided into documents so we can use it for our experiments. It is no coincidence ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "The TFIDF formula is quite popular in the field of Information Retrieval and it has been successfully applied in many NLP applications. It is often a standard measure of term relevance and you can hardly go wrong if you use it. Sometimes it seems that half of all NLP happens around the TFIDF formula :) (or some variation of it)."

When we take a look at the document, however, we can see it is in fact about **trade disputes in the _corn, gran_ industry**. The system has been able to make a correct inference and assign a new, correct category to the document, even when the human annotators did not do that themselves. This is a perfect example of bootstrapped/semi-supervised learning: we can first train an algorithm on some data annotated by people, and then use that system's decisions to easily add more data to our initial pool. Once a system gets to the point of being useful, it quickly becomes unstoppable :)\n",
    "5. And the cooler-yet result is hidden in the last group: at first, it seems a like a weird dump of different categories. All categories appear only once: the original document labeled as _earn_, the first suggestion as _iron-steel_, the others as _crude_ and _copper_. So, what happened here? Again, __machine learning happened__ :) If we pay attention to the documents' title, we can see that, in this group specifically, all dcuments start with the _TALKING POINT_ phrase. These documents are reports by analysts and feature prominently quotes of their statementsl. Although they have not been explicitly labeled as such in the Reuters corpus because in that corpus the tags are topic-based rather than genre-based, the algorithm does __sense__ something special and consistent about this group. If we look at the features triggering each match, it becomes evident that the pronoun _he_ is a constant, which makes sense because articles quoting analysts' opinions will tend to have a significant number of expressions like _he said, he claimed, he reported_. The system is able to pinpoint that on its own, and it is also interesting to think what would have happened if we had removed all stop words (_he_ is almost always considered one) -we would have lost one of the main predictors for the _talking point_ subset of our sample and would have probably never known it was there.

Apart from the cool factor of the name, it also happens to be technically correct :) (since we are building as our model a space containing some number of vectors, and the information in those vector faithfully represents semantic information -the relevance we saw in earlier sections-).\n",

    "That is why more efficient representations are commonly used. However, vectors are still at the core of any such representation, which simply use some trick or other to transform the vector into a more manageable object __without information loss__. Things can get very complicated in this area and there is an entire field of [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction) which is absolutely fascinating but totally beyond the scope of this course :D (For those who are really curious, you can check out (Random Forests/Ensemble Trees)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest] or (Principal Component Analysis)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis].\n",

    "A detailed technical explanation of intuitions behind the [__cosine similarity__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) would take some time :) so, to keep things simple, let's just say that it calculates the ratio between the sum of the weights of any non-zero-weight dimensions shared by two vectors, and the combined total weights for all dimensions of those two vectors. Because of operating in an Euclidean space, the final calculation also involves the __dot product__ and the __square root__ (see below for details :)"

    "Why is __Naïve Bayes__ called \"naïve\"? Because the model makes an assumption that is usually too well-intentioned :) Naïve Bayes models work on the feature __independence assumption__, which is, by the way, the mean reason why they are simple and fast, but also the main reason why so many people wonder how they can perform so well most of the time :)\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, the __independence assumption__ translates into the (very strong) assumption that the probabilities of each word in the document are independent from the presence of any other word in that document. That is, Naïve Bayes calculates the probability of words given the category of the documents they appear in (for instance, the fact that the word _politician_ appears more frequently in texts about politics), but it does not take into account the probability of a word given some other word (for instance, the fact that _politician_ and _ministry_ tend to appear together, or __co-ocurr__,  using the technical term, which stands for \"occurring/appearing together\").\n",
    "\n",
    "For Naïve Bayes, this means that two correlated words will each contribute to the overall score of the class. For the example above, _politician_ and _ministry_, that seems fine, though, since a text containing two words associated with the politics category should get some score from each separate word anyway. Independence seems fine in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "When is it not okay? In NLP, the __independence assumption__ can be particularly harmful with __collocations__ and __multiwords__. We will see these units in more detail in a bit, for now let's just say they are terms consisting of several tokens, such as _Barak H. Obama, president Barack Obama, cafe latte_ or _Lviv Computer Science Summer School_.\n",
    "\n",

To summarize, the __independence assumption__ may cause result in false positives due to awarding free (too generous) hits for tokens that are really parts of just one word. In NLP, this is a direct consequence of work-in-progress tokenization (now you see the importance of all that boring stuff about tokenization I told you about earlier ;) and how Computational Linguistics can make things easier for Machine Learning -__this__ is NLP). What this means is that not everything you can split on a whitespace is a word (and the fact that the opposite is also true is a *__well-known__ fact* ;), and sometimes the actual linguistic unit (the thing whose probability you should be calculating) will be something bigger, sometimes spanning a few words and sometimes even *discontinuous*, which makes it necessary to *__take__ these things __into account__*.\n",

Linear regression is the type of analysis that can tell you if people tend to have increasing amounts of ice-cream as temperatures rise towards the summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference of logistic regression with respect to standard linear regressions is that, whereas linear regression gives us a coefficient (how associated the independent and dependent variables are, with a value ranging from -1 to +1), logistic regression gives us a __probability-looking normalized score__ (a floating point number between 0. and 1.0) that we can use as an actual probability of the class (dependent variable) given the feature (independent variable). Zero means the feature does not predict the class, one means the feature predicts the class with absolute certainty. The normalization of this score is performed using the [__logistic function__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) (a type of [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function)) hence the technique's name.\n",

For convenience, below is some code ([via StackOverlow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7939259)) with a recap of linear regression.

That is, Logistic Regression __does not make the independence assumption__ and is able to deal feature correlations naturally by assigning them lower weights. In this way, a several-word-long linguistic unit no longer contributes to the final score for each of the tokens in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, Naïve Bayes calculates a probability for each word and finally multiplies the probabilities for all words, whereas Logistic Regression learns the weight for each word relative to the weights of rest of the words and, therefore, assigns to each its individual contribution over the maximum contribution that they all add up to.\n",

Essentially, they perform the same type of analysis as Logistic Regression classifiers (if we are talking about linear SVMs) with some differences in what is considered or high or low correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, Naïve Bayes often performs just as well as SVM classifiers (or better, despite their much higher simplicity) and Logistic Regression usually outperforms both. In my own experience, Maximum Entropy is usually the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main factor to look for when deciding when to use SVMs is the dimensionality of our space: SVMs can handle high numbers of dimensions but they usually cannot handle the multi-dimensionality of NLP data (at least, no without some serious normalization and dimensionality reduction, which are always possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the main reason why they will probably not be very useful unless you have some way to carry out a massive clean-up and normalization of the data."

    "These results are preliminary but very exciting nevertheless. Just to give you a frame of reference, below is a summary of some state-of-the-art results for classification on these corpora (some of these benchmarks are a bit old but I have not been able to find any more recents papers reporting better scores -which definitely does not mean they do not exist):\n",
    "\n",
    "* [This 2015 paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giacomo_Domeniconi/publication/281743455_A_Study_on_Term_Weighting_for_Text_Categorization_A_Novel_Supervised_Variant_of_tfidf/links/55f6ad7708aeafc8abf4f470.pdf) reports a maximum accuracy of nearly 94% and average accuracies of 92% on the Reuters corpus using __SVMs, and a number of variations of TFIDF as the feature weighting function, and feature selection__. The same configuration yielded scores in the mid-70% range on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. In our cases, __a barely normalized BoW-based vector space model combined with a Logistic Regression classifier__ allowed us to come very close of their top performance for Reuters (within 3-4%) and to outperform by ~10% their results on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. This is the kind of thing why we said earlier that Logistic Regression is usually the way to go ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the Brown corpus, one of the top accuracies reported is [a 2010 52%-result](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P10-1077) (over all categories, so quite low but definitely better than random -because you have many more categories than just two, which would amount to a 50% random baseline assuming a uniform distribution-). Our out-of-the box, nearly unmodified classifier matched that performance effortlessly, despite the fact that the authors of that paper were using more advanced features. Again, Logistic Regression can be seen to account for the difference (they used Linear Discriminant Analyis, a precursor to Logistic Regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Again on the 20 Newsgroups classifiers, the [Stanford team](http://nlp.stanford.edu) (in many ways, the founders of Natural Language Processing and modern Computational Linguistics) [report a nearly 82% accuracy](http://nlp.stanford.edu/wiki/Software/Classifier/20_Newsgroups) using their classifier. They report some previous results performing up to the ~82% mark, but they also report as \"suspect\" an earlier result achieving nearly 85% accuracy. Our own results suggest this last result actually seemed on the right track :) (for obvious reasons, Stanford people do not like other people getting better accuracies ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A note on evaluation metrics\n",
    "In these experiments, evaluation is being done in terms of [__Accuracy__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision). Other widely-user important metrics are [__Precision__ and __Recall__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) you should be familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, a simplified definition of __accuracy__ is used, not its stronger, technical one. Technically speaking, accuracy refers to how consistent a system's measurements are over time. A system __could be accurate while at the same time delivering really poor performance__ (as long as it delivers consistently poor performance :)\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, results consistency over time is generally measured as __macro-averaged precision__ over several experimental runs, for instance, and __accuracy__ is used as a synonym of precision when precision and recall converge. That is, all three terms can generally be used as equivalent when our task is such that every _X_ has a corresponding _Y_ and the system can either assign the right _Y_ or not, but always assigns one. I will make it clearer in a minute, stay with me ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine you are pub-questing around Lviv (it could happen ;) Let's imagine the crazy organizers ask you to go to the Opera House and convince 5 Ukrainians of singing the first act of [Rigoletto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigoletto) with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume you get 3 people to do it (by bribing them with ice-cream, for instance ;) but let's also assume there are 3 other people who are not really Ukrainian but have heard you saying you will buy them ice-cream and that they really, really want the ice-cream. Two of them totally look like tourists so you can easily tell them to go away but the third one does look like he might be Ukrainian and you absolutely want to win the pub quest so you decide to risk it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, your Precision is 2/3 and your Recall is 2/5. The number of actual Ukrainians who joined you (2) is called __true positives__, the number of false non-Ukrainians who joined (1) you is called __false positives__, the people you are missing to achieve the goal (3) are called __false negatives__, and the number of people you managed not to get fooled into buying an ice-cream (2) to is called _true negatives_.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, when you are a teacher you get to tell your students to either sing Rigoletto or go home with a note for their parents. Since they will all have to make a decision, __there can be no false negatives__ (i.e., any student who is not classified into singing or not singing); since you cannot force other teacher's students to sing Rigoletto, __there cannot be any false positives__, either; and since the choice is an a/b choice (a dichotomy), the boolean values __true__ and __false__ already account for all the variation, which is why __only Precision applies__ and, as we said, it is used as a synonym of __Accuracy__ in this particular case.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For the purposes of NLP, [__sentiment analysis__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) is just a binary or ternary classification problem: binary when classifying into __positive__ or __negative__ sentiment, ternary for tasks also involving a third class for __neutral__ sentiment (neither positive or negative). The terms __positive__ or __negative__ here refer to the subjective notion of goodness: _Daenerys Targaryen = good_, _Cersei Lannister = bad_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of algorithms and workflow, the task remains essentially the same as standard document __classification__, which means that most of the time an actual implementation will consist in training a classifier over as much data as we can lay our hands on :), then run new data through the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sentiment analysis (and classification more generally), data size is very likely to be the key performance factor. Feature engineering can help but probably less than just throwing more data at the system, at least in terms of getting quick gains. This is partly because sentiment analysis is a relatively vague task with a lot of long-tail variation but a very well-defined subset of frequent terms used to express positive or negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, every language has a limited set of swearwords that all speakers learn pretty fast (twice as fast if you are a foreigner :) Given enough data, the system can easily learn that list of words from the training examples. Once you know the term _freaking disgrace_, there is little ambiguity left that could mislead the system :) A similar pattern applies to positive sentiment -the information we want to capture in both cases is in the words themselves (and can therefore be modelled using a BoW-model) rather than in higher-order information like combinations of those words.\n",

    "##### A very important lesson\n",
    "So, two things are important here: first, the results this time are awful -we are very likely __not__ beating anyone's state-of-the-art performance this time XD If you remember the structure of our sentiment dataset (which contained only __positive__ and __negative__ labels), we are performing binary classification so a random baseline would give us 0.5 accuracy. We are close to 0.8 but not even there yet, which means that our model is definitely better than random but not extremely better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other important thing to note here is that features harmed performance more than anything else -it definitely seems that, in the case of sentiment analysis, whatever the system needs to learn that is going to help it determine whether something is positive or negative, is already there, regardless of our current features and regardless of our polarity dictionaries. This implies that, as long as we have data available, we do not really need to do anything with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key lessons here are:\n",
    "1. Algorithms will tend to see correlations in the data more easily than we can, which means that, theoretically, they can determine whether two variables are significantly associated more reliably than we can. As long as the __data is clean__, they will find whatever we want them to find. Yet again, another reason to take very seriously our earlier point about knowing the data.\n",
    "2. Additional data will maximize Recall and, given enough data, we will not be able to teach our system with a dictionary anything it has not learned from the corpus already. In the battle for classification, corpus always beats dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, __polarity dictionaries__ have been used to assign a sentiment to an input text based on the sentiment of the words in that text. In our _wlp_ repository I have included a class called __Sentiment__ illustrating the use of a good range of existing dictionary[1]-based sentiment analysis libraries for Python: __[Afinn](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/afinn), [SenticNet](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/senticnet/0.5.0), [SentiWordNet__](http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it), and __Vader__ (the last one comes with NLTK and I have included a copy of SentiWordNet in the repository, but the other two should be installed. There is a good chance I forgot to ask the organizers to do it ;) so feel free to run _for lib in sentic afinn; do pip install $lib; done_ from the command line whenever you have a second if you want to try the code).\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that data is usually enough to get a prototype running does not mean that there are not some additional types of information that would also be necessary to correctly understand sentiment. Complex phenomena exist that it would be great to be able to model, but in general there are practical limitations as to how much complexity you want to build into the system: fine-grained sentiment detection would require a deep understanding of syntactic structure on the part of the system, which is a non-trivial task (more on that in a bit). It is also strongly domain-dependent, as well, which means that you would normally need to focus on a particular domain to be able to improve your system significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] In this context, dictionaries are also called _lexicons_ in the field of NLP."

    "### Challenges of sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said, fine-grained, high-quality sentiment analysis is a tricky business and it would require more than just a classifier trained on BoW model. Apart from the often-cited issues stemming from figurative language use such as sarcasm, irony, or metaphors, and apart from the standard problems of all NLP-related tasks (co-references, ambiguity), some of the basic aspects of language also pose challenges of their own. Just to name a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Negation__. Weird as it may seem, this still poses a problem for many NLP systems. Given that it is a logical rather than a statistical phenomenon, it is difficult to teach a system to interpret natural language negations in a quantitative manner. Usually, most systems end up implementing some rule-based approach for dealing with negation, such as switching the polarity of some number of words following a negation term. The challenge, as usual in NLP, is linguistic variation: there are just too many ways of negating something.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Modulated polarity__. If you remember, during the introduction we mention the phenomenon of __modulation__, the fact that some words' meaning is actually updated in context and does not fully exist independently (except in a very abstract representation). This is also true in sentiment analysis, where the polarity of some words depends on the context in which they appear: _high resolution_ is great, whereas _high price_ is not great at all. There is definitely sentiment involved in these expressions, although it is neither explicit or trivial, that is, there is no unambiguous marker that the system can learn from the data (the _freaking disgrace_ example from above). The sentiment is built compositionally by our minds while interpreting the semantic content of the terms involved: _price_ is generally an objective reality (neutral), but the commonsense-knowledge assumption is that humans do not want to pay high prices because they do not want to spend money. This is the kind of knowledge most systems still do not have, although a very successful paradigm has been recently introduced that is already able to handle some of these phenomena: __aspect-based sentiment analysis__. Each concept is decomposed into its salient aspects (price and resolution in the case of a screen, for instance), and the model training incorporates information as to which words refer to each aspect independently and, therefore, which ones are positive for one of the aspects and may not be for the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Domain-specificity__. A lot of sentiment-related information requires domain-specific data (or dictionaries). Some things could be seen as negative in a domain but not in another. A sentence like _The company shipped 10,000 jobs overseas_ would be probably negative in a text about politics. In a financial report, however, it could be positive in a news item about cutting costs, or negative in a news item about national employment, or rather: negative for the company forced to do the cutting, neutral for the network that is reporting the news, and positive as a measure that may still help save the struggling company. Sentiment is a by definition a subjective category and an oversimplification of what goes on in people's minds. Currently, most sentiment analysis technology can just be seen as __swearword detectors__ :) They can detect obvious mentions of explicit sentiment, but they have no clue as to the potential semantic interactions modulating the final sentiment of a given text. For that, an in-depth knowledge (=data) of the domain is required and, for very specific tasks or narrow domains, that information is usually not there. In all those cases, lexicon-driven approaches will be a good way to fill the gaps. When enough data is available, though, no amount of dictionaries should get in the way of training a Logistic Regression classifier :)"
